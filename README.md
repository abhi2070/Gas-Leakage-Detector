# Gas-Leakage-Detector
I designed and developed a functional gas leakage detector using Arduino IDE.
The device is capable of detecting potentially hazardous gas leaks in homes and businesses. The project involved utilizing an Arduino Uno board, an MQ-6 gas sensor, an LED, a buzzer, and an LCD to create a synchronous system that alerts the user through visual and auditory cues when gas is detected.
